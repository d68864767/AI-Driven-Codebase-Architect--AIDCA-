# AI-Driven Codebase Architect (AIDCA)

AIDCA is a Node.js application that utilizes artificial intelligence to generate and manage complex, efficient, and scalable directory trees for software projects. It's designed to optimize the structure of a project's file system based on the project's specific needs and parameters.

## Features

1. **AI-Powered Directory Structure Optimization**: Uses machine learning algorithms to analyze the project's requirements and generate the most efficient directory structure.
2. **Dynamic Adaptation**: Continuously learns from the development patterns and adapts the directory structure for optimal performance and organization.
3. **Automated File Management**: Automatically creates, moves, and deletes files and directories based on the evolving needs of the project, adhering to best practices.
4. **Real-Time Collaboration Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with collaboration tools to allow team members to understand and follow the evolving structure.
5. **Version Control Optimization**: Integrates with version control systems like Git, optimizing file structure for efficient branching, merging, and conflict resolution.
6. **Extensive Documentation Generation**: Automatically generates and updates documentation for the directory structure, ensuring clarity for all team members.
7. **Customizable AI Models**: Allows developers to train the AI on specific project types or development methodologies.
